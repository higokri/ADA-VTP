## 📖 Overview

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have adopted visual token pruning strategies to mitigate substantial computational overhead incurred by extensive visual token sequences. While prior works primarily focus on either attention-based or diversity-based pruning methods, in-depth analysis of these approaches' characteristics and limitations remains largely unexplored.

In this work, we conduct thorough empirical analysis using effective rank (erank) as a measure of feature diversity and attention score entropy to investigate visual token processing mechanisms and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## 🔍 Key Findings

Our analysis reveals two key insights:

1. **Diversity-based pruning methods preserve substantially less feature diversity than intended**, and the diversity they do retain is closely tied to increased hallucination frequency compared to attention-based pruning.

2. **Attention-based approaches are more effective on simple images** where visual evidence is concentrated, while **diversity-based methods better handle complex images** with distributed features.

Building on these empirical insights, we show that incorporating image-aware adjustments into existing hybrid pruning strategies consistently improves their performance. We also provide a minimal instantiation of our empirical findings through a simple adaptive pruning mechanism.
